    <h2> METROBAND - The Metronome Wristband</h2>
    <br>Done in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the module <i>EN 1190 Engineering Design Project</i>
</div>

<br>Aim of this project is to create an alternative to the traditional Metronome, with a digitally controlled vibrating wristband. This repository contains all the documentation, code, schematics, PCB designs, and simulations of the project.
<br>Above works were done by Yasith Silva ([@yasith46](https://github.com/yasith46)), Bimsara Nawarathne ([@bimsaranawa](https://github.com/bimsaranawa)), Isuranga Senavirathne ([@isuranga1](https://github.com/isuranga1)) and Julian Silva ([@JulianSilva2001](https://github.com/JulianSilva2001)).
